              Do you want to know how to design and program the computers
              powering some of today’s greatest innovations? Ever wondered how
              your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how Google’s
              self-driving car is even possible, or how your music and photos
              live in the cloud? <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe you want to know how computers protect businesses — and
              people — and other cybersecurity issues. AUM’s Computer Science
              Program, with a curriculum based on the latest ACM/IEEE
              recommendations and an emphasis on high-performance computing,
              will prepare you for a career in computer programming, networking,
